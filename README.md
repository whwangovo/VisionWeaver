This repository contains the official implementation of <b>Vision Weaver</b> and the <b>VHBench-10</b> benchmark. Vision Weaver is a novel architecture designed to mitigate object hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) by dynamically aggregating features from multiple specialized visual encoders.

## üì£ News

- `[2025.09.17]`  üî• We have released our paper on arXiv. 
- `[2025.09.17]`  üî• The code for Vision Weaver and the VHBench-10 benchmark are now available at our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/whwangovo/VisionWeaver). 

## üòÆ Highlights

Object hallucinations, describing objects or attributes not present in an image, critically undermine the reliability of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). We hypothesize that different visual encoders possess distinct inductive biases, leading to varied hallucination patterns. To address this, we introduce **Vision Weaver**, a Context-Aware Routing Network that intelligently leverages the strengths of multiple visual experts.

### VHBench-10: A Fine-Grained Hallucination Benchmark

To systematically analyze hallucination, we developed **VHBench-10**, a benchmark designed to evaluate LVLMs across 10 fine-grained hallucination categories. These are grouped into four core visual competencies: **Detection, Segmentation, Localization, and Classification**. 

### Vision Weaver: A Context-Aware Routing Network

Vision Weaver dynamically aggregates visual features from multiple specialized encoders, guided by the model's global visual understanding. It uses the `[CLS]` token from a primary CLIP encoder to generate routing signals, which create a weighted fusion of features from experts like DINOv2, SAM, and Vary, thereby reducing hallucinations and improving overall performance.

## üê≥ VHBench-10 Benchmark

VHBench-10 is a core contribution of our work, enabling a fine-grained diagnosis of visual perception failures in LVLMs. 

- **Structure**: The dataset contains approximately 10,000 samples. Each sample is a ternary `(I, R, H)`, where `I` is the image, `R` is the real, factually accurate caption, and `H` is a caption with a specific, deliberately injected hallucination. 
- **Categories**: The benchmark covers 10 distinct sub-categories, including Color, Shape, Counting, Text Recognition, Relative Position, and more. 
- **Generation**: Hallucinated captions were generated using GPT-4O-mini, guided by specialized prompts to target each sub-category. 

The complete benchmark is available for download at our [HF repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/KirenWH/VHBench_10).
